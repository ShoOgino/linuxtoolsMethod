     * and should not block the caller for too long.
     *
     * Implementors can usually call their own getEventTotal(),
     * getEventsInRange(), etc. but should do so in a separate thread, and
     * should send a {@link TmfStatsUpdatedSignal} whenever they are done (that
     * signal will carry the results).
     *
     * @param isGlobal
     *            Is this for a global query (whole time range of a trace), or
     *            just for a specific time range.
     * @param start
     *            The start time of the query range. Has no effect if isGlobal
     *            is true.
     * @param end
     *            The end time of the query range. Has no effect if isGlobal is
     *            true.
