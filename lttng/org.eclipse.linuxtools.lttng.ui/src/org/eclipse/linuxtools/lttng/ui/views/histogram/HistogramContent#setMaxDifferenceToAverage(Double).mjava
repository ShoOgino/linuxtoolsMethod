	 * Note : this is used in some drawing calculation so make sure this number make sense.
	 * Note : the given number is multiplied by the bar width, as we have bigger bar (so more events as average to consider)
	 * Note : you might want to call recalculateEventHeight() if you change this.
	 * 
	 * @param newDiffToAverage	The new maximum difference to the average to use.
