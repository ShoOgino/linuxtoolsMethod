     * empty. It works similarly to querySingleState().

     * To retrieve the other values in a stack, you can query the sub-attributes
     * manually.

     *            pushAttribute() at creation time)
     * @return The interval that was at the top of the stack, or 'null' if the
     *         stack was empty.
     * @throws StateValueTypeException
     *             If the target attribute is not a valid stack attribute (if it
     *             has a string value for example)
     * @throws AttributeNotFoundException
     *             If the attribute was simply not found
