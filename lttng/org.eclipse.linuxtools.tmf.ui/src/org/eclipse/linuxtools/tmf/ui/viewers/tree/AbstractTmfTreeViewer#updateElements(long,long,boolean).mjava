     * Update the entries to the given start/end time. An extra parameter
     * defines whether these times correspond to the selection or the visible
     * range, as the viewer may update differently in those cases. This methods
     * returns a root node that is not meant to be visible. The children of this
     * 'fake' root node are the first level of entries that will appear in the
     * tree. If no update is necessary, the method should return
     * <code>null</code>. To empty the tree, a root node containing an empty
     * list of children should be returned.
     *
     * This method is not called in the UI thread when using the default viewer
     * content update. Resource-intensive calculations here should not block the
     * UI.
