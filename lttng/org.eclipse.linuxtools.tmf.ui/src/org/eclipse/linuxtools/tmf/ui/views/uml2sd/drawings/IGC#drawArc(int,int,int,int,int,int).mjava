     * Draws the outline of a circular or elliptical arc within the specified rectangular area. The resulting arc begins

     * value indicates a clockwise rotation. The center of the arc is the center of the rectangle whose origin is (x, y)
     * and whose size is specified by the width and height arguments. The resulting arc covers an area width + 1 pixels
     * wide by height + 1 pixels tall.
