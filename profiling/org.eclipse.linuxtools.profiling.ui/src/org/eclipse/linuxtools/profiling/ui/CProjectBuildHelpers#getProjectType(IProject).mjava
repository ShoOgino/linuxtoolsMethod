     * <h1>Finds out the type of the project as defined by {@link ProjectBuildType ProjectBuildType}.</h1>
     *
     * <p>
     * A project can be of different types.<br>
     * Common types are:
     * <ul>
     * - <li>Autotools</li>
     * - <li>Managed Make project</li>
     * - <li>Manual Makefiles</li>
     * </ul>
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * Some dialogues (initially in gCov & gProf) distinguish between these when displaying dialogues. This code is used
     * by these dialogues.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * The method was writen with extensibility in mind. <br>
     * Other routines check for autotools/Managed make, and if those are not present, then it shows generic advice about
     * adding flags. MAKEFILE per-se isn't really checked. I.e this means that it should be safe to add additional
     * project types.
     * </p>
     *
     * @param project  project for which you want to get the type.
     * @return (enum)  projectType : <br>
     *         AUTO_TOOLS, <br>
